Compatibility
==============

Microsoft ended support for Windows XP on [April 8th, 2014](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/WindowsForBusiness/end-of-xp-support),
an OS initially released in 2001. This means that not even critical security
updates will be released anymore. Without security updates, using a bitcoin
wallet on a XP machine is irresponsible at least.

In addition to that, with 0.12.x there have been varied reports of Bitcoin Knots
randomly crashing on Windows XP. It is [not clear](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/7681#issuecomment-217439891)
what the source of these crashes is, but it is likely that upstream
libraries such as Qt are no longer being tested on XP.

We do not have time nor resources to provide support for an OS that is
end-of-life. From 0.13.0 on, Windows XP is no longer supported. Users are
suggested to upgrade to a newer version of Windows, or install an alternative OS
that is supported.

No attempt is made to prevent installing or running the software on Windows XP,
you can still do so at your own risk, but do not expect it to work: do not
report issues about Windows XP to the issue tracker.

Notable changes
===============

Sensitive data is no longer stored in debug console history
-----------------------------------------------------------

Since v0.11.0, Knots has supported saving the debug console history across
restarts. This was intended to exclude sensitive data, such as private keys
and the wallet passphrase, but the logic to detect this was skipped in
practice (this security issue is assigned CVE-2016-????).

This security issue is fixed as of this release. Additionally, when you start
Knots, it will scan through your current persisted history and filter out any
sensitive information it finds. This is implemented such that the sensitive
info is erased as securely as possible, but due to the nature of configuration
storage, it is unlikely to succeed in entirely removing it from your disk.

Segregated witness soft fork
----------------------------

Segregated witness (segwit) is a soft fork that, if activated, will
allow transaction-producing software to separate (segregate) transaction
signatures (witnesses) from the rest of the data in a transaction, and
to allow miners to place those witnesses outside of the traditional
block structure. This provides two immediate benefits:

- **Elimination of malleability:** Segregating the witness allows both
  existing software and upgraded software that receives transactions to
  calculate the transaction identifier (txid) of segwit-using
  transactions without referencing the witness. This solves all known
  cases of unwanted third-party transaction malleability, which is a
  problem that makes programming Bitcoin wallet software more difficult
  and which seriously complicates the design of smart contracts for
  Bitcoin.

- **Capacity increase:** Moving witness data outside of the traditional
  block structure (but still inside a new-style block structure) means
  new-style blocks can hold more data than older-style blocks, allowing
  a modest increase to the amount of transaction data that can fit in a
  block.

Segwit also simplifies the ability to add new features to Bitcoin and
improves the efficiency of full nodes, which will help provide long-term
benefits to Bitcoin users.

Activation for the segwit soft fork is being managed using BIP9
versionbits.  Segwit's version bit is bit 1, and nodes will begin
tracking which blocks signal support for segwit at the beginning of the
first retarget period after segwit's start date of 15 November 2016.  If
95% of blocks within a 2,016-block retarget period (about two weeks)
signal support for segwit, the soft fork will be locked in.  After
another 2,016 blocks, segwit will activate.

For more information about segwit, please see the [segwit FAQ][], the
[segwit wallet developers guide][] or BIPs [141][BIP141], [143][BIP143],
[144][BIP144], and [145][BIP145].  If you're a miner or mining pool
operator, please see the [versionbits FAQ][] for information about
signaling support for a soft fork.

Null dummy soft fork
-------------------

Combined with the segwit soft fork is a soft fork that turns a
long-existing network relay policy into a consensus rule.  The
`OP_CHECKMULTISIG` and `OP_CHECKMULTISIGVERIFY` opcodes consume an extra
stack element ("dummy element") after signature validation. The dummy
element is not inspected in any manner, and could be replaced by any
value without invalidating the script.

Because any value can be used for this dummy element, it's possible for
a third-party to insert data into other people's transactions, changing
the transaction's txid (called transaction malleability) and possibly
causing other problems.

Since Bitcoin Core 0.10.0, nodes have defaulted to only relaying and
mining transactions whose dummy element was a null value (0x00, also
called OP_0).  The null dummy soft fork turns this relay rule into a
consensus rule both for non-segwit transactions and segwit transactions,
so that this method of mutating transactions is permanently eliminated
from the network.

Signaling for the null dummy soft fork is done by signaling support
for segwit, and the null dummy soft fork will activate at the same time
as segwit.

For more information, please see [BIP147][].

[BIP147]: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0147.mediawiki

Bumpfee RPC method
------------------

A new RPC method `bumpfee` has been added enabling reissuing opt-in RBF
transactions with a higher fee. The caller must explicitly specify the output
to be decremented offsetting the increased fee. See `help bumpfee` for usage.

Support for multiple wallets
----------------------------

You can load multiple wallets at startup by specifying the `-wallet` parameter
multiple times. For example, to simply load two wallets, you might start with
`bitcoin-qt -wallet=wallet.dat -wallet=wallet2.dat`. In this mode, the GUI will
show a dropdown box selector for which wallet to view.

For RPC access, only a single wallet can currently be used per RPC username.
An optional fourth field is added to the `rpcauth` configuration parameter to
specify which wallet file the username should access. If omitted, the first
loaded wallet is used. It can also be provided as a single hyphen to disable
wallet access for that user.

Note that multi-wallet support is currently experimental. It is not
well-tested, and may be removed in future releases.

Low-level RPC changes
---------------------

- `getblockchaininfo` now includes the block height at which BIP 9 softforks
  activated.
- `importmulti` has been updated to the final version merged into Bitcoin Core.
  In addition to greatly expanding its capabilities, this brings a minor break
  to the interface: the second parameter has changed from a boolean controlling
  rescanning, to a JSON Object with a single `rescan` key.
- `importprunedfunds` only accepts two required arguments. Some versions accept
  an optional third arg, which was always ignored. Make sure to never pass more
  than two arguments.

Memory pool not prefilled
-------------------------

When connecting to new peers, their memory pool is no longer requested. This
was found to use too much bandwidth and not done at the appropriate time.


Linux ARM builds
----------------

With the 0.13.0 release, pre-built Linux ARM binaries were added to the set of
uploaded executables. Additional detail on the ARM architecture targeted by each
is provided below.

The following extra files can be found in the download directory or torrent:

- `bitcoin-${VERSION}-arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.gz`: Linux binaries targeting
  the 32-bit ARMv7-A architecture.
- `bitcoin-${VERSION}-aarch64-linux-gnu.tar.gz`: Linux binaries targeting
  the 64-bit ARMv8-A architecture.

ARM builds are still experimental. If you have problems on a certain device or
Linux distribution combination please report them on the bug tracker, it may be
possible to resolve them. Note that the device you use must be (backward)
compatible with the architecture targeted by the binary that you use.
For example, a Raspberry Pi 2 Model B or Raspberry Pi 3 Model B (in its 32-bit
execution state) device, can run the 32-bit ARMv7-A targeted binary. However,
no model of Raspberry Pi 1 device can run either binary because they are all
ARMv6 architecture devices that are not compatible with ARMv7-A or ARMv8-A.

Note that Android is not considered ARM Linux in this context. The executables
are not expected to work out of the box on Android.
